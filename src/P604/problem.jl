Let F(N) be the maximum number of lattice points in an axis-aligned N\times N square that the graph of a single 
strictly convex
 increasing function can pass through.


You are given that F(1) = 2, F(3) = 3,  F(9) = 6, F(11) = 7, F(100) = 30 and F(50000) = 1898.
 
Below is the graph of a function reaching the maximum 3 for N=3:


Find F(10^{18}).
