content = """
For a positive integer n, define f(n) to be the number of non-empty substrings of n that are divisible by 3. For example,
the string "2573" has 10 non-empty substrings, three of which represent numbers that are divisible by 3, namely 57, 573 and 3. So
f(2573) = 3.

If f(n) is divisible by 3 then we say that n is 3-like.

Define F(d) to be how many d digit numbers are 3-like. For example, F(2) = 30 and F(6) = 290898.

Find F(10‚Åµ). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
