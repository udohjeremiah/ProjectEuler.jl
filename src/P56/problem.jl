A googol (10¹⁰⁰) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100¹⁰⁰ is almost unimaginably large: one followed
by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, aᵇ, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
