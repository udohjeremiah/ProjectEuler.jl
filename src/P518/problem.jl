Let S(n) = Σ a+b+c over all triples (a,b,c) such that:

   • a, b, and c are prime numbers.
   • a < b < c < n.
   • a+1, b+1, and c+1 form a \e[1mgeometric sequence.\e[0m

For example, S(100) = 1035 with the following triples: 

(2, 5, 11), (2, 11, 47), (5, 11, 23), (5, 17, 53), (7, 11, 17), (7, 23, 71), (11, 23, 47), (17, 23, 31), (17, 41, 97), (31, 47, 71), (71, 83,
97)

Find S(10⁸).
