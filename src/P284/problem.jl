The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of numbers with the special property that its square
ends with the same digits: 376² = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.

Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is
also a steady square: c37² = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c
and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal numbering system.

For 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal).
Steady squares with leading 0's are not allowed.

Find the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system for
1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 (decimal) and give your answer in the base 14 system using lower case letters where necessary.
