A triplet of positive integers (
a
,
b
,
c
) is called a Cardano Triplet if it satisfies the condition:

\sqrt[3]{a + b \sqrt{c}} + \sqrt[3]{a - b \sqrt{c}} = 1



For example, (2,1,5) is a Cardano Triplet.


There exist 149 Cardano Triplets for which 
a
+
b
+
c
 ≤ 1000.


Find how many Cardano Triplets exist such that 
a

b

c
 ≤ 110,000,000.
