A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.
For any denominator, d, there will be d-1 proper fractions; for example, with d = 12:
¹/₁₂ , ²/₁₂ , ³/₁₂ , ⁴/₁₂ , ⁵/₁₂ , ⁶/₁₂ , ⁷/₁₂ , ⁸/₁₂ , ⁹/₁₂ , ¹⁰/₁₂ , ¹¹/₁₂ .

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = ⁴/₁₁ .
In fact, d = 12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) < ⁴/₁₀ .

Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) < ¹⁵⁴⁹⁹/₉₄₇₄₄ .
