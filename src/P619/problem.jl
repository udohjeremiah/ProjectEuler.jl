For a set of positive integers {a, a+1, a+2, â€¦ , b}, let C(a,b) be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of
all elements is a perfect square.

For example C(5,10)=3, since the products of all elements of {5, 8, 10}, {5, 8, 9, 10} and {9} are perfect squares, and no
other subsets of {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} have this property.

You are given that C(40,55) =15, and C(1000,1234) mod 1000000007=975523611.

Find C(1000000, 1234567) mod 1000000007.
