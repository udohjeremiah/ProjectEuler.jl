The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

     Fₙ = Fₙ-1 + Fₙ-2, where F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1.

It turns out that F₅₄₁, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital
(contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F₂₇₄₉, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for
which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

Given that Fₖ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
