content = """
The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer b, denoted by a↑↑b or bᵃ, is recursively defined by:

a↑↑1 = a,
a↑↑(k+1) = a⁽ᵃ↑↑ᵏ⁾.

Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 3³ = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 3²⁷ = 7625597484987 and 3↑↑4 is roughly 10³.⁶³⁸³³⁴⁶⁴⁰⁰²⁴⁰⁹⁹⁶*¹⁰^¹².

Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.
