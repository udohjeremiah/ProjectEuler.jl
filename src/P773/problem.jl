Let Sₖ be the set containing 2 and 5 and the first k primes that end in 7. For example, S₃ = {2,5,7,17,37}.

Define a k-Ruff number to be one that is not divisible by any element in Sₖ.

If Nₖ is the product of the numbers in Sₖ then define F(k) to be the sum of all k-Ruff numbers less than Nₖ that have last digit
7. You are given F(3) = 76101452.

Find F(97), give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
