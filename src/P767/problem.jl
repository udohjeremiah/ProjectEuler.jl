A window into a matrix is a contiguous sub matrix.

Consider a 16 × n matrix where every entry is either 0 or 1. Let B(k,n) be the total number of these matrices such that the
sum of the entries in every 2 × k window is k.

You are given that B(2,4) = 65550 and B(3,9) ≡ 87273560 (mod 1 000 000 007).

Find B(10⁵, 10¹⁶). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
