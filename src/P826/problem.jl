Consider a wire of length 1 unit between two posts. Every morning n birds land on it randomly with every point on the wire
equally likely to host a bird. The interval from each bird to its closest neighbour is then painted.

Define F(n) to be the expected length of the wire that is painted. You are given F(3) = 0.5.

Find the average of F(n) where n ranges through all odd prime less than a million. Give your answer rounded to 10 places
after the decimal point.
