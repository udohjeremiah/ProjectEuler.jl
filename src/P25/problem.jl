The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, where F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

   F₁ = 1
   F₂ = 1
   F₃ = 2
   F₄ = 3
   F₅ = 5
   F₆ = 8
   F₇ = 13
   F₈ = 21
   F₉ = 34
   F₁₀ = 55
   F₁₁ = 89
   F₁₂ = 144

The 12th term, F₁₂, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
