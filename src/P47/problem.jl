The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

              14 = 2 × 7
              15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

             644 = 2² × 7 × 23
             645 = 3 × 5 × 43

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?
