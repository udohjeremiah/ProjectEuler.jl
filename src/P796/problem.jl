A standard 52 card deck comprises thirteen ranks in four suits. However, modern decks have two additional Jokers, which
neither have a suit nor a rank, for a total of 54 cards. If we shuffle such a deck and draw cards without replacement, then we
would need, on average, approximately 29.05361725 cards so that we have at least one card for each rank.

Now, assume you have 10 such decks, each with a different back design. We shuffle all 0 Ã— 54 cards together and draw
cards without replacement. What is the expected number of cards needed so every suit, rank and deck design have at least
one card?

Give your answer rounded to eight places after the decimal point.
