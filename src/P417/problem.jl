A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

       ¹/₂  = 0.5
       ¹/₃  = 0.(3)
       ¹/₄  = 0.25
       ¹/₅  = 0.2
       ¹/₆  = 0.1(6)
       ¹/₇  = 0.(142857)
       ¹/₈  = 0.125
       ¹/₉  = 0.(1)
       ¹/₁₀ = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that ¹/₇ has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0. 

Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n. You are given that ∑ L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.

Find ∑ L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 000.
