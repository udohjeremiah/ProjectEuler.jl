Both 169 and 961 are the square of a prime. 169 is the reverse of 961.

We call a number a reversible prime square if:

  1. It is not a palindrome, and
  2. It is the square of a prime, and
  3. Its reverse is also the square of a prime.

169 and 961 are not palindromes, so both are reversible prime squares.

Find the sum of the first 50 reversible prime squares.
