You are given a unique investment opportunity.

Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f, of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000
tosses.

Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.

For example, if f = 1/4,  for the first toss you bet £0.25, and if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet
£0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.

Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least £1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a
billionaire?

All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in
the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
