Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a
distance x is exactly (1 - Ë£/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50.

During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely
a 2% chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.

Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
