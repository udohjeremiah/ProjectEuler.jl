It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

               4 + 1
               3 + 2
               3 + 1 + 1
               2 + 2 + 1
               2 + 1 + 1 + 1
               1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?
