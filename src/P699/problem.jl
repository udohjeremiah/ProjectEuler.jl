Let \sigma(n) be the sum of all the divisors of the positive integer n, for example:

\sigma(10) = 1+2+5+10 = 18.


Define T(N) to be the sum of all numbers n \le N such that when the fraction \frac{\sigma(n)}{n} is written in its lowest form \frac ab, the denominator is a power of 3 i.e. b = 3^k, k > 0.


You are given T(100) = 270 and T(10^6) = 26089287.


Find T(10^{14}).
