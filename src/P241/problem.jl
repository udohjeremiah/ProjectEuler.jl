content = """
For a positive integer n, let \\sigma(n) be the sum of all divisors of n. For example, \\sigma(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.
A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with \\sigma(n) = 2n.
Let us define the 
perfection quotient
 of a positive integer as p(n) = \\dfrac{\\sigma(n)}{n}.
Find the sum of all positive integers n \\le 10^{18} for which p(n) has the form k + \\dfrac{1}{2}, where k is an integer.
