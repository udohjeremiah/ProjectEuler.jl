Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation:
b^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2 + a^2 z^2 = a^2 b^2.
Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.

If a = 1 mm and b = 1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is \dfrac{28}{3} \pi mm

If a = 2 mm and b = 1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm

.
Find the amount of chocolate in mm
