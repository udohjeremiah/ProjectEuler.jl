By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to
bottom is 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in\e[1;35m https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p067_triangle.txt \e[0m, a 15K text file containing a

\e[1mNOTE\e[0m: This is a much more difficult version of \e[1;35mProblem 18\e[0m. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2⁹⁹ altogether!
If you could check one trillion (10¹²) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm
to solve it. ;o)
