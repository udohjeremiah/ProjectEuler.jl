Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive
integer, n, for which the equation, x²  - y² - z² = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:

                                                 34² - 27² - 20² = 12² - 9² - 6² = 27

It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.

How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
