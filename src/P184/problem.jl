Consider the set 
I
r
 of points (
x
,
y
) with integer co-ordinates in the interior of the circle with radius 
r
, centered at the origin, i.e. 
x
2
 + 
y
2
 < 
r
2
.
For a radius of 2, 
I
2
 contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight triangles having all three vertices in 
I
2
 which contain the origin in the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from these by rotation.
For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the interior and having all vertices in 
I
3
 and for 
I
5
 the number is 10600.
How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and having all three vertices in 
I
105
?
