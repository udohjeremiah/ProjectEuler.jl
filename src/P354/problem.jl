Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.

One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.

For a positive real number L, let \text{B}(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. 

For example, \text{B}(\sqrt 3)=6, \text{B}(\sqrt {21}) = 12 and \text{B}(111\,111\,111) = 54.
Find the number of L \le 5 \times 10^{11} such that \text{B}(L) = 450.
