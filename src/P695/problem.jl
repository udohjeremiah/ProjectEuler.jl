Three points, P_1, P_2 and P_3, are randomly selected within a unit square. Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of the unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three line segments \\overline{P_1P_2}, \\overline{P_1P_3} or \\overline{P_2P_3} (see picture below).
We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the diagonal \\overline{P_2P_3}.
Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
