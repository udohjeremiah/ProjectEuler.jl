2⁷ = 128 is the first power of two whose leading digits are "12".
The next power of two whose leading digits are "12" is 2⁸⁰.

Define p(L, n) to be the nth-smallest value of j such that the base 10 representation of 2ʲ begins with the digits of L.
So p(12, 1) = 7 and p(12, 2) = 80.

You are also given that p(123, 45) = 12710.

Find p(123, 678910).
