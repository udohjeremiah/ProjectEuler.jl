Consider the equation17ᵖa + 19ᵖb + 23ᵖc = n where a, b, c and p are positive integers, i.e. a,b,c,p > 0.

For a given p there are some values of n > 0 for which the equation cannot be solved. We call these unreachable values.

Define G(p) to be the sum of all unreachable values of n for the given value of p. For example G(1) = 8253 and
G(2)= 60258000.

Find G(6). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
