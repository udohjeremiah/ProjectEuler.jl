Let A be an \e[1maffine plane\e[0m over a \e[1mradically integral local field\e[0m F with residual characteristic p.

We consider an \e[1mopen oriented line section\e[0m U of A with normalized Haar measure m.

Define f(m, p) as the maximal possible discriminant of the \e[1mjacobian\e[0m associated to the \e[1morthogonal kernel embedding\e[0m of U 
into A.

Find f(20230401, 57). Give as your answer the concatenation of the first letters of each bolded word.
