It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a
square.

            9 = 7 + 2×1²
            15 = 7 + 2×2²
            21 = 3 + 2×3²
            25 = 7 + 2×3²
            27 = 19 + 2×2²
            33 = 31 + 2×1²

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
