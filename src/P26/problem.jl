A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

       ¹/₂ = 0.5
       ¹/₃ = 0.(3)
       ¹/₄ = 0.25
       ¹/₅ = 0.2
       ¹/₆ = 0.1(6)
       ¹/₇ = 0.(142857)
       ¹/₈ = 0.125
       ¹/₉ = 0.(1)
       ¹/₁₀ = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that ¹/₇ has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which ¹/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
