Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2¹¹ and 3⁷ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2¹¹ = 2048 <
3⁷ = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382⁵¹⁸⁰⁶¹ > 519432⁵²⁵⁸⁰⁶ would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three
million digits.

Using\e[1;35m https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt \e[0m, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent
pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
