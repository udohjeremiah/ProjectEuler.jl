We call an integer sided triangle n-pandigital if it contains one angle of 120 degrees and, when the sides of the triangle are
written in base n, together they use all n digits of that base exactly once.

For example, the triangle (217, 248, 403) is 9-pandigital because it contains one angle of 120 degrees and the sides written in
base 9 are 261₉, 305₉, 487₉ using each of the 9 digits of that base once.

Find the sum of the largest sides of all n-pandigital triangles with 9 ≤ n ≤ 18.
