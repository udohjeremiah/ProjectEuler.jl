A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the left.

We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.

A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.

We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.


It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.



Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.


This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.


If 
n
 circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the 
n
 circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of 
n
 for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is 
n
 = 15.


What is the least value of 
n
 for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?
