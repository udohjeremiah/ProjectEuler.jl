Consider the triangle with sides \\sqrt 5, \\sqrt {65} and \\sqrt {68}.
It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.
S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides \\sqrt{1+b^2}, \\sqrt {1+c^2} and \\sqrt{b^2+c^2}\\, (for positive integers b and c) that have an integral area not exceeding n.
The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.
S(10^6)=18018206.
Find S(10^{10}).
