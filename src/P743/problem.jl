A window into a matrix is a contiguous sub matrix.

Consider a 2 × n matrix where every entry is either 0 or 1.
Let A(k,n) be the total number of these matrices such that the sum of the entries in every 2 × k window is k.

You are given that A(3,9) = 560 and A(4,20) = 1060870.

Find A(10⁸, 10¹⁶). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
