Given is an integer sided triangle 
ABC
 with 
BC
 ≤ 
AC
 ≤ 
AB
.
k
 is the angular bisector of angle 
ACB
.
m
 is the tangent at 
C
 to the circumscribed circle of 
ABC
.
n
 is a line parallel to 
m
 through 
B
.

The intersection of 
n
 and 
k
 is called 
E

How many triangles 
ABC
 with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such that 
BE
 has integral length?
