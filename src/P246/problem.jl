A definition for an ellipse is:

Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that d(G,M)<r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.


The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.



Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).
 
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.

The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.

From a point P outside e the two tangents t
1
 and t
2
 to the ellipse are drawn.

Let the points where t
1
 and t
2
 touch the ellipse be R and S.


For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?
