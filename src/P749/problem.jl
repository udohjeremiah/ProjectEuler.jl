content = """
A positive integer, n, is a near power sum if there exists a positive integer, k, such that the sum of the kth powers of the digits
in its decimal representation is equal to either n+1 or n-1. For example 35 is a near power sum number because
3² + 5² = 34.

Define S(d) to be the sum of all near power sum numbers of d digits or less. Then S(2) = 110 and S(6) = 2562701.

Find S(16).
