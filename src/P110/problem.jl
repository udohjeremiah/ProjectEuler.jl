In the following equation 
x
, 
y
, and 
n
 are positive integers.
\\dfrac{1}{x} + \\dfrac{1}{y} = \\dfrac{1}{n}
It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?
NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of 
Problem 108
 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
