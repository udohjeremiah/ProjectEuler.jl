content = """
A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) =
111111.

Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is
divisible by n, and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.

The least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds ten is 17.

Find the least value of n for which A(n) first exceeds one-million.
