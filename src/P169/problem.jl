Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of different ways n can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power
no more than twice.

For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:

             1 + 1 + 8
             1 + 1 + 4 + 4
             1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4
             2 + 4 + 4
             2 + 8

What is f(10²⁵)?
