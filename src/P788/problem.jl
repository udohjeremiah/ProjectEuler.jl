A dominating number is a positive integer that has more than half of its digits equal.

For example, 2022 is a dominating number because three of its four digits are equal to 2. But 2021 is not a dominating
number.

Let D(N) be how many dominating numbers are less than 10á´º. For example, D(4) = 603 and D(10) = 21893256.

Find D(2022). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
