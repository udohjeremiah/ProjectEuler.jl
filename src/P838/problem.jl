Let f(N) be the smallest positive integer that is not coprime to any positive integer n ≤ N whose least significant digit is 3.

For example f(40) equals to 897 = 3 ⋅ 13 ⋅ 23 since it is not coprime to any of 3,13,23,33. By taking the natural logarithm
\e[1;35m(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm)\e[0m (log to base e) we obtain ln f(40) = ln897 ≈ 6.799056 when
rounded to six digits after the decimal point.

You are also given ln f(2800) ≈ 715.019337.

Find f(10⁶). Enter its natural logarithm rounded to six digits after the decimal point.
