A 
hexagonal orchard
 of order 
n
 is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side 
n
. The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:


Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.


Let H(
n
) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order 
n
.


H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.


Find H(100 000 000).
