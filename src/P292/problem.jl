We shall define a pythagorean polygon to be a \e[1mconvex polygon\e[0m with the following properties:

  • there are at least three vertices,
  • no three vertices are aligned,
  • each vertex has \e[1minteger coordinates,\e[0m
  • each edge has \e[1minteger length.\e[0m

For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is ≤ n.
Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.

You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.
Find P(120).
