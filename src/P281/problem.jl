You are given a pizza (perfect circle) that has been cut into 
m
·
n
 equal pieces and you want to have exactly one topping on each slice.
Let 
f
(
m
,
n
) denote the number of ways you can have toppings on the pizza with 
m
 different toppings (
m
 ≥ 2), using each topping on exactly 
n
 slices (
n
 ≥ 1). 
Reflections are considered distinct, rotations are not. 
Thus, for instance, 
f
(2,1) = 1, 
f
(2,2) = 
f
(3,1) = 2 and 
f
(3,2) = 16. 
f
(3,2) is shown below:
Find the sum of all 
f
(
m
,
n
) such that 
f
(
m
,
n
) ≤ 10
15
.
