content = """
Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points,
we choose m-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create m segments.

Let E(n, m) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment. For example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7. Note that if
multiple segments have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the
shortest length.

Find E(10‚Å∑, 100). Give your answer rounded to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point.
