The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the
equation, x² - y² - z² = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:

                                                       13² - 10² - 7² = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
