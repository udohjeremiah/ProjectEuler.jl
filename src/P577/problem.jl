An equilateral triangle with integer side length n \\ge 3 is divided into n^2 equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the diagram below.

The vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)} 2 lattice points.
Let H(n) be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by connecting 6 of these points.

For example, H(3)=1, H(6)=12 and H(20)=966.
Find \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=3}^{12345} H(n).
