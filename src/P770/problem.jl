A and B play a game. A has originally 1 gram of gold and B has an unlimited amount. Each round goes as follows:

   • A chooses and displays, x, a nonnegative real number no larger than the amount of gold that A has.
   • Either B chooses to TAKE. Then A gives B x grams of gold.
   • Or B chooses to GIVE. Then B gives A x grams of gold.

B TAKEs n times and GIVEs n times after which the game finishes.

Define g(X) to be the smallest value of n so that A can guarantee to have at least X grams of gold at the end of the game.
You are given g(1.7) = 10.

Find g(1.9999).
