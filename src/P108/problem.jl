In the following equation 
x
, 
y
, and 
n
 are positive integers.

\\dfrac{1}{x} + \\dfrac{1}{y} = \\dfrac{1}{n}

For 
n
 = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

\\begin{align}
\\dfrac{1}{5} + \\dfrac{1}{20} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\
\\dfrac{1}{6} + \\dfrac{1}{12} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\
\\dfrac{1}{8} + \\dfrac{1}{8} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}
\\end{align}



What is the least value of 
n
 for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
NOTE: This problem is an easier version of 
Problem 110
; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
