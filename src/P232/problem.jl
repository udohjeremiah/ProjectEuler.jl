On Player 1's turn, the coin is tossed once. If it comes up Heads, then Player 1 scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no
points are scored.

On Player 2's turn, a positive integer, T, is chosen by Player 2 and the coin is tossed T times. If it comes up all Heads, then
Player 2 scores 2ᵀ⁻¹ points; otherwise, no points are scored.
