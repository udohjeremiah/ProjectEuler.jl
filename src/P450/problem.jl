A hypocycloid is the curve drawn by a point on a small circle rolling inside a larger circle. The parametric equations of a hypocycloid centered at the origin, and starting at the right most point is given by:
x(t) = (R - r) \\cos(t) + r \\cos(\\frac {R - r} r t)
y(t) = (R - r) \\sin(t) - r \\sin(\\frac {R - r} r t)
Where R is the radius of the large circle and r the radius of the small circle.
Let C(R, r) be the set of distinct points with integer coordinates on the hypocycloid with radius 
R
 and 
r
 and for which there is a corresponding value of 
t
 such that \\sin(t) and \\cos(t) are rational numbers.

Let S(R, r) = \\sum_{(x,y) \\in C(R, r)} |x| + |y| be the sum of the absolute values of the x and y coordinates of the points in C(R, r).
Let T(N) = \\sum_{R = 3}^N \\sum_{r=1}^{\\lfloor \\frac {R - 1} 2 \\rfloor} S(R, r) be the sum of S(R, r) for 
R
 and 
r
 positive integers, R\\leq N  and 2r < R.
You are given:
C(3, 1)
=
\\{(3, 0), (-1, 2), (-1,0), (-1,-2)\\}
C(2500, 1000)
=
\\{(2500, 0), (772, 2376), (772, -2376), (516, 1792), (516, -1792), (500, 0), (68, 504), (68, -504),
Â 
(-1356, 1088), (-1356, -1088), (-1500, 1000), (-1500, -1000)\\}
Note:
 (-625, 0) is not an element of C(2500, 1000) because \\sin(t) is not a rational number for the corresponding values of t.
S(3, 1) = (|3| + |0|) + (|-1| + |2|) + (|-1| + |0|) + (|-1| + |-2|) = 10
T(3) = 10; T(10) = 524; T(100) = 580442; T(10^3) = 583108600.
Find T(10^6).
