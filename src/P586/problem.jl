The number 209 can be expressed as a² + 3ab + b² in two distinct ways:

     209 = 8² + 3 ⋅ 8 ⋅ 5 + 5²
     209 = 13² + 3 ⋅ 13 ⋅ 1 + 1²

Let f(n,r) be the number of integers k not exceeding n that can be expressed as k = a² + 3ab + b², with a > b > 0
integers, in exactly r different ways.

You are given that f(10⁵, 4) = 237 and f(10⁸, 6) = 59517.

Find f(10¹⁵, 40).
