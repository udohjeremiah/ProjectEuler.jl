Consider the following Diophantine equation:

                                          15(x² + y² + z²) = 34(xy + yz + zx)

where x, y and z are positive integers.

Let S(N) be the sum of all solutions, (x,y,z), of this equation such that, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ N and gcd(x, y, z) = 1.

For N = 10², there are three such solutions - (1, 7, 16), (8, 9, 39), (11, 21, 72). So S(10²) = 184.

Find S(10⁹).
