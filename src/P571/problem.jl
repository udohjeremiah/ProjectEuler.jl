A positive number is \e[1mpandigital\e[0m in base b if it contains all digits from 0 to b - 1 at least once when written in base b.
 
A n-super-pandigital number is a number that is simultaneously pandigital in all bases from 2 to n inclusively.
For example 978 = 1111010010₂ = 1100020₃ = 33102₄ = 12403₅ is the smallest 5-super-pandigital number.
Similarly, 1093265784 is the smallest 10-super-pandigital number.
The sum of the 10 smallest 10-super-pandigital numbers is 20319792309.

What is the sum of the 10 smallest 12-super-pandigital numbers?
