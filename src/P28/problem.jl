Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

                                                       \e[1;91m21\e[0m 22 23 24 \e[1;91m25\e[0m
                                                       20  \e[1;91m7\e[0m  8  \e[1;91m9\e[0m 10
                                                       19  6  \e[1;91m1\e[0m  2 11
                                                       18  \e[1;91m5\e[0m  4  \e[1;91m3\e[0m 12

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
