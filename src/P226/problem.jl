The 
blancmange curve
 is the set of points (x, y) such that 0 \\le x \\le 1 and y = \\sum \\limits_{n = 0}^{\\infty} {\\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}, where s(x) is the distance from x to the nearest integer.
The area under the blancmange curve is equal to Â½, shown in pink in the diagram below.
Let 
C
 be the circle with centre \\left ( \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2} \\right ) and radius \\frac{1}{4}, shown in black in the diagram.
What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by 
C
?
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 
0.abcdefgh
