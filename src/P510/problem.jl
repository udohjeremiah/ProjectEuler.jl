Circles A and B are tangent to each other and to line L at three distinct points.

Circle C is inside the space between A, B and L, and tangent to all three.

Let 
r
A
, 
r
B
 and 
r
C
 be the radii of A, B and C respectively.
Let 
S
(
n
) = 
∑
 
r
A
 + 
r
B
 + 
r
C
, for 0 < 
r
A
 ≤ 
r
B
 ≤ 
n
 where 
r
A
, 
r
B
 and 
r
C
 are integers.
The only solution for 0 < 
r
A
 ≤ 
r
B
 ≤ 5 is 
r
A
 = 4, 
r
B
 = 4 and 
r
C
 = 1, so 
S
(5) = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9.
You are also given 
S
(100) = 3072.
Find 
S
(10
