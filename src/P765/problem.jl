content = """
Starting with 1 gram of gold you play a game. Each round you bet a certain amount of your gold: if you have x grams you can
bet b grams for any 0 ≤ b ≤ x. You then toss an unfair coin: with a probability of 0.6 you double your bet (so you now have
x + b), otherwise you lose your bet (so you now have x - b).

Choosing your bets to maximize your probability of having at least a trillion (10¹²) grams of gold after 1000 rounds, what is the
probability that you become a trillionaire?

All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
