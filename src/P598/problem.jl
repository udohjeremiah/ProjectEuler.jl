Consider the number 48.
There are five pairs of integers a and b(a ≤ b) such that a × b = 48: (1,48), (2,24), (3,16), (4,12) and (6,8).
It can be seen that both 6 and 8 have 4 divisors.
So of those five pairs one consists of two integers with the same number of divisors.

In general:
Let C(n) be the number of pairs of positive integers a × b = n, (a ≤ b) such that a and b have the same number of divisors; 
so C(48)=1.

You are given C(10!)=3: (1680, 2160), (1800, 2016) and (1890,1920).
 
Find C(100!)
