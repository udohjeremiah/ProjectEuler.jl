Two players play a game with two piles of stones, alternating turns.

On each turn, the corresponding player chooses a positive integer n and does one of the following:

  • removes n stones from one pile;
  • removes n stones from both piles; or
  • removes n stones from one pile and 2n stones from the other pile.

The player who removes the last stone wins.

We denote by (n,m) the position in which the piles have n and m stones remaining. Note that (n,m) is considered to be the
same position as (m,n).

Then, for example, if the position is (2,6), the next player may reach the following positions:
(0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)

A position is a losing position if the player to move next cannot force a win. For example, (1,3), (2,6), (4,5) are the first few
losing positions.

Let f(M) be the sum of n+m for all losing positions (n,m) with n ≤ m and n + m ≤ M. For example, f(10) = 21, by
considering the losing positions (1,3), (2,6), (4,5).

You are given that f(100) = 1164 and f(1000) = 117002.

Find f(10⁷).
