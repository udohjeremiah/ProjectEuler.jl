A 
spherical triangle
 is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by three 
great circular arcs
 intersecting pairwise in three vertices.
Let C(
r
) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius 
r
.

Let Z(
r
) be the set of points on the surface of C(
r
) with integer coordinates.

Let T(
r
) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(
r
).
Degenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great arc, are 
not
 included in T(
r
).

Let A(
r
) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(
r
).
For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.
Find \sum \limits_{r = 1}^{50} {A(r)}. Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
