The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8³ = 512.
Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28⁴.

We shall define aₙ to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that a₂ = 512 and a₁₀ = 614656.

Find a₃₀.
