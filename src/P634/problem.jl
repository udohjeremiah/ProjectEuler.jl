Define F(n) to be the number of integers x ≤ n that can be written in the form x = a²b³, where a and b are integers not
necessarily different and both greater than 1.

For example, 32 =2² × 2³ and 72 = 3² × 2³ are the only two integers less than 100 that can be written in this form. Hence,
F(100) = 2.

Further you are given F(2 × 10⁴) = 130 and F(3 × 10⁶) = 2014.

Find F(9 × 10¹⁸).
