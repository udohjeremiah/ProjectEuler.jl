Consider graphs built with the units A: 

and B: 
, where the units are glued along
the vertical edges as in the graph 
.
A configuration of type (
a
,
b
,
c
) is a graph thus built of 
a
 units A and 
b
 units B, where the graph's vertices are coloured using up to 
c
 colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.

The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,
c
) for all 
c
 â‰¥ 4.
Let N(
a
,
b
,
c
) be the number of configurations of type (
a
,
b
,
c
).

For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.
Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).
