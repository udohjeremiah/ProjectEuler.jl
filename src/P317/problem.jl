content = """
A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which
move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s².

Find the volume (in m³) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer
rounded to four decimal places.
