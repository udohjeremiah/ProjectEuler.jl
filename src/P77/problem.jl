It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

                7 + 3
                5 + 5
                5 + 3 + 2
                3 + 3 + 2 + 2
                2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
