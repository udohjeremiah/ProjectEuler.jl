A \e[1mHilbert number\e[0m is any positive integer of the form 4k+1 for integer k ≥ 0.  We shall define a squarefree Hilbert number as
a Hilbert number which is not divisible by the square of any Hilbert number other than one.  For example, 117 is a squarefree
Hilbert number, equaling 9 ×13. However 6237 is a Hilbert number that is not squarefree in this sense, as it is divisible by 9².
The number 3969 is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by both 9² and 21².  

There are 2327192 squarefree Hilbert numbers below 10⁷. 
How many squarefree Hilbert numbers are there below 10¹⁶?
