content = """
A \e[1mgozinta chain\e[0m for n is a sequence {1,a,b,...,n} where each element properly divides the next. 
For example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for 12:
{1,12}, {1,2,12}, {1,2,4,12}, {1,2,6,12}, {1,3,12}, {1,3,6,12}, {1,4,12} and {1,6,12}.

Let S(n) be the sum of all numbers, k, not exceeding n, which have 252 distinct gozinta chains. 
You are given S(10⁶)=8462952 and S(10¹²)=623291998881978.

Find S(10³⁶), giving the last nine digits of your answer.
