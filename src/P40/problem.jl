An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

                                           0.12345678910\e[1;91m1\e[0m112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12ᵗʰ digit of the fractional part is 1.

If dₙ represents the nᵗʰ digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

d₁ × d₁₀ × d₁₀₀ × d₁₀₀₀ × d₁₀₀₀₀ × d₁₀₀₀₀₀ × d₁₀₀₀₀₀₀
