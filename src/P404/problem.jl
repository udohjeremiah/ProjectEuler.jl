E
a
 is an ellipse with an equation of the form x
2
 + 4y
2
 = 4
a
2
.

E
a
' is the rotated image of E
a
 by θ degrees counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0° < θ < 90°.

b
 is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the origin and 
c
 is the distance of the two other intersection points.

We call an ordered triplet (
a
, 
b
, 
c
) a 
canonical ellipsoidal triplet
 if 
a
, 
b
 and 
c
 are positive integers.

For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.


Let C(
N
) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (
a
, 
b
, 
c
) for 
a
 ≤ 
N
.

It can be verified that C(10
3
) = 7, C(10
4
) = 106 and C(10
6
) = 11845.


Find C(10
17
