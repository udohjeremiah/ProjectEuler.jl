If a triple of positive integers (a, b, c) satisfies a² + b² = c², it is called a Pythagorean triple. No triple (a, b, c) satisfies
aᵉ + bᵉ = cᵉ when e ≥ 3 (Fermat's Last Theorem). However, if the exponents of the left-hand side and right-hand side differ,
this is not true. For example, 3³ + 6³ = 3⁵.

Let a, b, c, e, f be all positive integers, 0 < a < b, e ≥ 2, f ≥ 3 and cᶠ ≤ N. Let F(N) be the number of (a, b, c, e, f) such
that aᵉ + bᵉ = cᶠ. You are given F(10³) = 7, F(10⁵) = 53 and F(10⁷) = 287.

Find F(10¹⁸).
