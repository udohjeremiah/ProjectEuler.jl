content = """
The 
Gauss Factorial
 of a number n is defined as the product of all positive numbers \\leq n that are relatively prime to n. For example g(10)=1\\times 3\\times 7\\times 9 = 189. 
Also we define
\\displaystyle G(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}g(i)
You are given G(10) = 23044331520000.
Find G(10^8). Give your answer modulo 1\\,000\\,000\\,007.
