A positive integer, n, is factorised into prime factors. We define f(n) to be the product when each prime factor is replaced with 2. In addition we define f(1)=1.
For example, 90 = 2\\times 3\\times 3\\times 5, then replacing the primes, 2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2 = 16, hence f(90) = 16.
Let \\displaystyle S(N)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} f(n). You are given S(10^8)=9613563919.
Find S(10^{14}).
