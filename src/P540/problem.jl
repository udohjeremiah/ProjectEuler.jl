A \e[1mPythagorean triple\e[0m consists of three positive integers a, b and c satisfying a²+b²=c².
The triple is called primitive if a, b and c are relatively prime.
Let P(n) be the number of \e[1mprimitive Pythagorean triples\e[0m with a < b < c ≤ n.
For example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).

You are given that P(10⁶) = 159139.
Find P(3141592653589793).
