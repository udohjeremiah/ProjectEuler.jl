content = """
In the classic "Crossing Ladders" problem, we are given the lengths 
x
 and 
y
 of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. We are also given the height 
h
 above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (
w
).
Here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are positive integers.

For example, if 
x
 = 70, 
y
 = 119 and 
h
 = 30, we can calculate that 
w
 = 56.
In fact, for integer values 
x
, 
y
, 
h
 and 0 < 
x
 < 
y
 < 200, there are only five triplets (
x
,
y
,
h
) producing integer solutions for 
w
:

(70, 119, 30), (74, 182, 21), (87, 105, 35), (100, 116, 35) and (119, 175, 40).
For integer values 
x
, 
y
, 
h
 and 0 < 
x
 < 
y
 < 1 000 000, how many triplets (
x
,
y
,
h
) produce integer solutions for 
w
?
