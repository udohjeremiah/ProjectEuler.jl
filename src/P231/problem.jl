The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.

$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$, and $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.

So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.


Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {20\,000\,000} {15\,000\,000}$.
