Consider all the triangles having:

All their vertices on 
lattice points
.
Circumcentre
 at the origin O.
Orthocentre
 at the point H(5, 0).
There are nine such triangles having a perimeter ≤ 50.

Listed and shown in ascending order of their perimeter, they are:
A(-4, 3), B(5, 0), C(4, -3)

A(4, 3), B(5, 0), C(-4, -3)

A(-3, 4), B(5, 0), C(3, -4)

A(3, 4), B(5, 0), C(-3, -4)

A(0, 5), B(5, 0), C(0, -5)

A(1, 8), B(8, -1), C(-4, -7)

A(8, 1), B(1, -8), C(-4, 7)

A(2, 9), B(9, -2), C(-6, -7)

A(9, 2), B(2, -9), C(-6, 7)
The sum of their perimeters, rounded to four decimal places, is 291.0089.
Find all such triangles with a perimeter ≤ 10
5
.

Enter as your answer the sum of their perimeters rounded to four decimal places.
