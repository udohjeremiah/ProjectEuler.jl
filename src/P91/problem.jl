content = """
The points P (
x
1
, 
y
1
) and Q (
x
2
, 
y
2
) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.
There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
0 ≤ 
x
1
, 
y
1
, 
x
2
, 
y
2
 ≤ 2.
Given that 0 ≤ 
x
1
, 
y
1
, 
x
2
, 
y
2
 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
