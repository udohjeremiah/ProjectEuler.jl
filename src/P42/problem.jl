The nᵗʰ term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tₙ = ½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

                                             1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a
word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t₁₀. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall
call the word a triangle word.

how many are triangle words?
